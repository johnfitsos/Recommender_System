How to run:
1)You need to make sure that all the required libraries are installed in python
2)Also it is required to have the 3 initial dataset csv files at the same folder with the main.py
3)All the functions inside the code will be able to run only when the function called 'main_part' has finish and provides the output.
  This will clean the dataset and it will calculate similarities for each user.
5)By default the code will start running and predict + evaluate the results for the whole dataset and later on only for some regions.
6)After that it will ask for your credentials and once you provide them correctly it will create a database and store the results inside
  In order for this to work you will have to run both main_part() and prediction_world()
7)Once main part has run it will output a csv with the similarities. This is a required input of all the other functions in order to avoid recalculation of it.
  Besides that the other functions are independent in terms of predicting and evalueting the results.
8)At the end of each part it will print the evaluation tests (mae,nmae,mrse)
More other there is a function to predict the ratings for a specific country which you will have to choose
